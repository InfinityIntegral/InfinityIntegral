So now we begin, working together to win <br>
Believing in trust, it must be possible to overcome anything <br>
There's so much to do, there's so much we can contribute <br>
By sharing just a little love, we'll start again anew <br>

So why don't we try? If we stand side by side <br>
I know we'll build [a new world, a world of hope for ever after](https://github.com/InfinityIntegral/SGEXTN) [(documentation here)](https://infinityintegral.github.io) <br>

# My Profile

Hi, I am Tianle, a student from Singapore. On my GitHub is my projects typically using SGEXTN (my own extension layer over Qt Quick) and written in C++. Currently, I am working on SGEXTN v6.0.0

## 05524F.sg

You may have noticed this organisation name in my applications. This is my "organisation name" when I am coding my own projects. The mission of 05524F is to build free and open source software for everyone in Singapore and beyond.

05524F.sg projects include:<br>
- SGEXTN - Qt Quick wrapper for easier software development<br>
- SingScript.sg - font to display Math and Science symbols

### [SGEXTN](https://github.com/InfinityIntegral/SGEXTN) (work in progress)

SGEXTN v6.0.0 is my wrapper around core Qt functionality (the stuff you need to build a basic application). With SGEXTN v6.0.0, you will not need to even include Qt headers at all (you still have to link the Qt DLL that matches the SGEXTN version you use). This means much faster compile times and clang-tidy runs because SGEXTN will have extremely clean header files. SGEXTN covers basic structs (colours, identifiers, timestamps, 2D vectors), the SGWidget GUI toolkit which internally uses Qt Quick to render, file system access APIs, wrappers around QChar and QString, a timer, and a dedicated class to programme renderers with the use of custom shaders. The SGWidget module, file system access, timer, and custom renders would be in separate DLLs. In future, I may decide to add zip file handling, screenshot functionality, web requests, and bluetooth communication. I kept promising SGEXTN would be ready for development but every time I wanted even more improvements, so no matter how good it is, SGEXTN WILL NOT BE READY FOR DEVELOPMENT USE until the documentation site, demo app, and maintenance tool are completed.

Apart from the SGEXTN library itself, I also plan to rebuild Colours++, an application that I made for a school project. In addition to that I want to make a dedicated SGEXTN demo app with the theme "celebrating the heartlands" featuring references to Singaporean places and culture. I also plan to build a SGEXTN maintenance tool that checks my website for updates and asks the user to install them, just like the Qt maintenance tool.

### [SingScript.sg](https://github.com/InfinityIntegral/SingScript.sg) (completed)

SingScript is NOT a scripting language. It is a font specialised in displaying Math, Science, and Computer Science symbols. The font includes a wide range of symbols in different modules, including superscripts, subscripts, Math operators, control pictures, table mockups, and Optical Answer Sheet bubbles. There is also a "everything" module for Qt compatibility. SingScript is on version 2.0.0 and is packaged as part of SGEXTN.
