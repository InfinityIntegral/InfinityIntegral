So now we begin, working together to win <br>
Believing in trust, it must be possible to overcome anything <br>
There's so much to do, there's so much we can contribute <br>
By sharing just a little love, we'll start again anew <br>

So why don't we try? If we stand side by side <br>
I know we'll build [a new world, a world of hope for ever after](https://github.com/InfinityIntegral/SGEXTN) [(documentation here)](https://infinityintegral.github.io) <br>

# My Profile

Hi, I am Tianle, a student from Singapore. On my GitHub is my projects typically using SGEXTN (my own extension layer over Qt Quick) and written in C++. Currently, I am working on ocuentation v1.0.0, a internal tool that generates code documentation and related materials without having to manually write Markdown or HTML.

## 05524F.sg

You may have noticed this organisation name in my applications. This is my "organisation name" when I am coding my own projects. The mission of 05524F is to build free and open source software for everyone in Singapore and beyond.

05524F.sg projects include:<br>
- SGEXTN - Qt Quick wrapper for easier software development<br>
- SingScript.sg - font to display Math and Science symbols

### [SGEXTN](https://github.com/InfinityIntegral/SGEXTN) (work in progress)

SGEXTN v6.0.0 is my wrapper around core Qt functionality (the stuff you need to build a basic application). With SGEXTN v6.0.0, you will not need to even include Qt headers or link Qt at all (you still have to provide the Qt DLL that matches the SGEXTN version you use though). This means much faster compile times and clang-tidy runs because SGEXTN will have extremely clean header files. SGEXTN covers basic structs (colours, identifiers, timestamps, 2D vectors), the SGWidget GUI toolkit which internally uses Qt Quick to render, file system access APIs, wrappers around QChar and QString, a timer, and a dedicated class to programme renderers with the use of custom shaders. The SGWidget module, file system access, and custom renders would be in separate DLLs. In future, I may decide to add zip file handling, web requests, and bluetooth communication. I kept promising SGEXTN would be ready for development but every time I wanted even more improvements, so no matter how good it is, SGEXTN WILL NOT BE READY FOR DEVELOPMENT USE until the documentation site and tests app is completed.

### [SingScript.sg](https://github.com/InfinityIntegral/SingScript.sg) (completed)

SingScript is NOT a scripting language. It is a font specialised in displaying Math, Science, and Computer Science symbols. The font includes a wide range of symbols in different modules, including superscripts, subscripts, Math operators, control pictures, table mockups, and Optical Answer Sheet bubbles. There is also a "everything" module for Qt compatibility. SingScript is on version 2.0.0 and is packaged as part of SGEXTN.
