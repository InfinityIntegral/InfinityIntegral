# My Profile

Hi, I am Tianle, a student from Singapore. On my GitHub is my projects typically using SGEXTN (my own extension layer over Qt Quick) and written in C++. Currently, I am working on the demo app for SGEXTN.

## 05524F.sg

You may have noticed this organisation name in my applications. This is my "organisation name" when I am coding my own projects. The mission of 05524F is to build free and open source software for everyone in Singapore and beyond.

05524F.sg projects include:<br>
- SGEXTN - Qt Quick wrapper for easier software development<br>
- SingScript.sg - font to display Math and Science symbols

### [SGEXTN](https://github.com/InfinityIntegral/SGEXTN) (completed)

SGEXTN is my own framework built on top of Qt Quick. It contains many utilities necessary to build apps, such as file system access and structs for colours, timestamps, GUIDs, and 2D vectors. The SGWidget GUI toolkit allows you to build GUI apps without using a single line of QML or JavaScript, without using signal-slot, and without QObject. SGEXTN is currently on version 5.1.0 and is suitable for development use.

### [SingScript.sg](https://github.com/InfinityIntegral/SingScript.sg) (completed)

SingScript is NOT a scripting language. It is a font specialised in displaying Math, Science, and Computer Science symbols. The font includes a wide range of symbols in different modules, including superscripts, subscripts, Math operators, control pictures, table mockups, and Optical Answer Sheet bubbles. There is also a "everything" module for Qt compatibility. SingScript is on version 2.0.0 and is packaged as part of SGEXTN.
