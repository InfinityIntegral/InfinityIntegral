# My Profile

Hi, I am Tianle, a student from Singapore. On my GitHub is my projects typically using SGEXTN (my own extension layer over Qt Quick) and written in C++. Currently, I am still building SGEXTN v4 which is required for my future projects.

## 05524F.sg

You may have noticed this organisation name in my applications. This is my "organisation name" when I am coding my own projects. The mission of 05524F is to build free and open source software for everyone in Singapore and beyond.

Current 05524F.sg projects include:<br>
- [ ] SGEXTN - Qt Quick wrapper for easier software development<br>
- [ ] SingScript.sg - font to display Math and Science symbols<br>
- [ ] SingNote.sg - note taking application<br>

### [SGEXTN](https://github.com/InfinityIntegral/SGEXTN) (active)

SGEXTN, short for "SG Extension" or "The Singaporean Extension", is my project to add a wrapper layer over Qt Quick to eliminate the need for declarative UI, QML, and JavaScript. Using SGEXTN feels like QWidget, but less powerful because I only included parts that I will use in my projects. For the things that I did not include, I can always add custom components in my applications. SGEXTN allows you to use imperative UI and code everything in C++.

Development for SGEXTN is active since I am building SGEXTN v4. This is expected to be the final major version of SGEXTN, but since originally I only planned 1 version, so that can change.

### [SingScript.sg](https://github.com/InfinityIntegral/SingScript.sg) (active)

SingScript is NOT a scripting language. It is just a font that is supposed to display Math and Science symbols. I am building this because it is required for some input fields in SGEXTN v4. The font is based from my own handwriting and its old name was "PrimaryScript for Learning and Examinations (PSLE)".

I plan to rebuild the font soon because the stroke weight for the current SingScript version is too big, so it would not work for some detailed mathematical symbols.

### [SingNote.sg](https://github.com/InfinityIntegral/SingNote.sg) (paused)

SingNote is supposed to be a note taking app. I actually have a prototype called "MathNote.sg", but it is built using Unity C# which is not C++, and it is not the most efficient, so I would not link to it. Currently, you see SingNote as a half built project that seem to be abandoned. This is because what you see now is based on QWidget, I want to work on SGEXTN first and then later rebuild it from SGEXTN.

SingNote is a paused project, the code inside is considered below 05524F standards and unsuitable for usage due to it using QWidget and that is not efficient enough.

## Am I blur
