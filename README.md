"Singaporean dimension": [SGEXTN](https://github.com/InfinityIntegral/SGEXTN)

# My Profile

Hi, I am Tianle, a student from Singapore. On my GitHub is my projects typically using SGEXTN (my own extension layer over Qt Quick) and written in C++. Currently, I am still building SGEXTN v5 which is required for my future projects.

💚 Qt framework<br>
💚 Qt Quick<br>
💚 QSB with GLSL<br>
💙 C++

## 05524F.sg

You may have noticed this organisation name in my applications. This is my "organisation name" when I am coding my own projects. The mission of 05524F is to build free and open source software for everyone in Singapore and beyond.

05524F.sg projects include:<br>
- [ ] SGEXTN - Qt Quick wrapper for easier software development<br>
- [x] SingScript.sg - font to display Math and Science symbols

### [SGEXTN](https://github.com/InfinityIntegral/SGEXTN) (active)

SGEXTN, short for "SG Extension" or "The Singaporean Extension", is my project to add a wrapper layer over Qt Quick to eliminate the need for declarative UI, QML, and JavaScript. Using SGEXTN feels like QWidget, but less powerful because I only included parts that I will use in my projects. For the things that I did not include, you can always add custom components in your applications. SGEXTN allows you to use imperative UI and code everything in C++, because J@v@scr!pt is exceptionally blur (literally, it has no clarity of types).

Development for SGEXTN is active since I am building SGEXTN v5. This is expected to be the final major version of SGEXTN, but I have been saying that while building v4 so maybe there will be a v6?

### [SingScript.sg](https://github.com/InfinityIntegral/SingScript.sg) (completed)

SingScript is NOT a scripting language. It is just a font that is supposed to display Math and Science symbols. The font is split into modules with each module covering a certain use case, such as Math symbols or Optical Answer Sheet stuff. Unfortunately, this does not work at all with Qt, so there is also a "everything" module with all supported characters in the same font file. If you need only certain modules, you can make your own SingScript subsets using the "merge font" functionality in FontForge. SingScript v2 has been completed already.

## Am I blur
