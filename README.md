# My Profile

Hi, I am Tianle, a student from Singapore. On my GitHub is my projects typically using SGEXTN (my own extension layer over Qt Quick) and written in C++. Currently, I am working on SGEXTN v5.1.0.

## 05524F.sg

You may have noticed this organisation name in my applications. This is my "organisation name" when I am coding my own projects. The mission of 05524F is to build free and open source software for everyone in Singapore and beyond.

05524F.sg projects include:<br>
- [x] SGEXTN - Qt Quick wrapper for easier software development<br>
- [x] SingScript.sg - font to display Math and Science symbols

### [SGEXTN](https://github.com/InfinityIntegral/SGEXTN) (ongoing)

SGEXTN is my own framework built on top of Qt Quick. It contains many utilities necessary to build apps, such as file system access and a struct for colours. The SGWidget GUI toolkit allows you to build GUI apps without using a single line of QML or JavaScript, without using signal-slot, and without QObject. SGEXTN is currently on version 5.0.0 and is suitable for development use. However, I have thought of a bit more changes and will be upgrading it to version 5.1.0 soon.

### [SingScript.sg](https://github.com/InfinityIntegral/SingScript.sg) (completed)

SingScript is NOT a scripting language. It is a font specialised in displaying Math, Science, and Computer Science symbols. The font includes a wide range of symbols in different modules, including superscripts, subscripts, Math operators, control pictures, table mockups, and Optical Answer Sheet bubbles. There is also a "everything" module for Qt compatibility. SingScript is on version 2.0.0 and is packaged as part of SGEXTN.
