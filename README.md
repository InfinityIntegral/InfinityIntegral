So now we begin, working together to win  
Believing in trust, it must be possible to overcome anything  
There's so much to do, there's so much we can contribute  
By sharing just a little love, we'll start again anew  

So why don't we try? If we stand side by side  
I know we'll build [a new world, a world of hope for ever after](https://github.com/InfinityIntegral/SGEXTN) [(documentation here)](https://infinityintegral.github.io/SGEXTN/readme/readme)
